# Frontend ecommerce built it in React Js 💻

## Description 📚

This project was my first website I made in react js. I used concepts like hooks, styled components, ternary operators, spread operators, array methods, React Router, component elements, web hosting images, etc.

The product data for this website was done by me in a single json file to simulate a database (that's why some titles, descriptions, images are duplicated but single product ids are uniq).

I am currently learning python to update this website and build its own backend properly.
