# A simple frontend ecommerce built it in React Js

## Description

This project was my first website I made in react js. I used concepts like hooks, styled components, ternary operators, spread operators, array methods, React Router, component elements, host images on the web, etc.

The products data of this website was made by me in a single json file to simulate a data base (thats why is duplicate some titles, descriptions, images but the ids of a single product is uniq).

I am currently learning python to upgrade this website and built it its own backend properly.
